### High level approach

-  Built all the static components first.
-  Added **state management** using **context & reducer**.
-  Implemented Articles listing.
-  Implemented **page number functionality**.
-  Implemented **search functionality**.
-  Added styles to all the components.
-  Finally, I refactored the codebase.

### Assumptions

-  No assumptions were made, the assignment documentation was pretty straightforward.
